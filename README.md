# this is my first website now on github!

**why did i move to github:** i really wanted to add more things to my site and the default neocities editor was really
limited and i really wanted a better editor also i preffer dealing with gits and also being able to use a external editor really easily, for example you can add a plugin in vscode soo that you can push the code directly to a git repo with no issues.
